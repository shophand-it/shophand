# Transfer ShopHand™ to Wix App Builder

## Migration Overview

Your ShopHand platform can be transferred to Wix, but it requires different approaches depending on your needs:

## Option 1: Wix Website + External Backend (Recommended)

**What to migrate to Wix:**
- Frontend design and pages
- User interface components
- Static content and branding

**What to keep external:**
- Node.js backend (current API)
- PostgreSQL database
- Authentication system
- Order processing logic

**Steps:**
1. Create Wix website with ShopHand design
2. Use Wix APIs to connect to your existing backend
3. Keep current server running for data processing
4. Best of both worlds: Wix ease + your advanced features

## Option 2: Full Wix Migration (Limited Features)

**Wix Limitations:**
- No custom Node.js server
- Limited database functionality
- Basic authentication only
- Simplified order processing

**What you can build in Wix:**
- Parts catalog display
- Basic contact forms
- Simple user registration
- Static informational pages
- Basic e-commerce with Wix Stores

**What you'll lose:**
- Complex driver network system
- Advanced order tracking
- Custom authentication
- Revenue analytics dashboard
- Real-time features

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Solution

### Step 1: Create Wix Frontend
1. Build ShopHand website in Wix with your branding
2. Create pages: Home, Parts Catalog, About, Contact
3. Use Wix design tools for professional appearance

### Step 2: Connect to Your Backend
1. Keep your current Node.js server running
2. Use Wix Corvid (Velo) to make API calls to your backend
3. Display data from your PostgreSQL database
4. Maintain all advanced functionality

### Step 3: Domain Setup
1. Use your Namecheap domain with Wix
2. Point main site to Wix
3. Use subdomain (api.yourdomain.com) for backend

## Code for Wix Integration

Here's how to connect Wix to your existing ShopHand backend:

```javascript
// In Wix Corvid/Velo
import { fetch } from 'wix-fetch';

// Connect to your ShopHand API
export async function getParts() {
  const response = await fetch('https://your-backend-url.com/api/parts');
  return response.json();
}

export async function createOrder(orderData) {
  const response = await fetch('https://your-backend-url.com/api/orders', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(orderData)
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

## Benefits of Hybrid Approach

✅ **Easy website management** with Wix tools
✅ **Keep all advanced features** from your current platform
✅ **Professional design** with drag-and-drop
✅ **Your custom domain** works perfectly
✅ **Revenue generation** continues working
✅ **Driver network** stays functional

## Next Steps

1. Would you like me to help deploy your current backend first?
2. Then create a Wix frontend that connects to it?
3. Or prefer full migration to Wix with simplified features?

The hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds!
