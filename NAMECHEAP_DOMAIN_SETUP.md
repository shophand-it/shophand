# ShopHand™ Domain Setup with Namecheap

## Important: Your App Needs Node.js Hosting

Your ShopHand platform is a Node.js application that requires:
- Node.js runtime environment
- PostgreSQL database
- Server-side processing

**Namecheap shared hosting won't work** for your app since it only supports PHP/HTML.

## Recommended Solution: Use Your Domain with Better Hosting

### Option 1: Railway + Namecheap Domain (Best)
1. **Deploy to Railway** (free Node.js hosting):
   - Go to railway.app
   - Deploy your ShopHand repository
   - Get your Railway URL (e.g., `shophand-production.railway.app`)

2. **Connect Your Namecheap Domain**:
   - In Namecheap dashboard, go to Domain List
   - Click "Manage" on your domain
   - Go to "Advanced DNS"
   - Add CNAME record:
     - Type: CNAME
     - Host: www
     - Value: `shophand-production.railway.app`
   - Add A record:
     - Type: A
     - Host: @
     - Value: Railway's IP (they'll provide this)

### Option 2: Vercel + Namecheap Domain
1. Deploy to Vercel (free)
2. In Vercel dashboard, add your custom domain
3. Update Namecheap DNS settings as directed by Vercel

### Option 3: Upgrade Namecheap Hosting
- **VPS Hosting** ($11.88/month) - Supports Node.js
- **Dedicated Server** ($48.88/month) - Full control

## Why This Approach Works Better

✅ **Free hosting** with Railway/Vercel
✅ **Professional domain** from Namecheap
✅ **Full Node.js support** for your app
✅ **Automatic HTTPS** and SSL
✅ **Better performance** than shared hosting

## Quick Steps to Go Live

   ```
